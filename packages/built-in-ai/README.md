A TypeScript library that provides access to browser-based AI capabilities with seamless fallback to using server-side models using the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/). This library enables you to leverage **Chrome** and **Edge's** built-in AI features ([Prompt API](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/prompt-api)) with the AI SDK.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @built-in-ai/core
```

The `@built-in-ai/core` package is the AI SDK provider for your Chrome and Edge browser's built-in AI models. It provides seamless access to both language models and text embeddings through browser-native APIs.
